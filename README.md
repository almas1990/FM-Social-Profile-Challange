## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While working on this project, I reinforced my understanding of semantic HTML, flexbox for layout, and how to implement responsive design using a mobile-first approach. I also learned to customize hover states for a better user experience.

Here's a code snippet showcasing the hover effect for the social links:
```css
main ul li:hover {
  background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  cursor: pointer;
  color: black;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to continue refining my CSS skills, especially when it comes to more advanced layouts using CSS Grid. Additionally, I would like to explore using more sophisticated design elements like transitions and animations.
